## Getting Started

To get started with Vuegolith, follow the steps below:

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Onur169/vuegolith.git`
2. Navigate to the project root directory: `cd vuegolith`
3. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
4. Install Go dependencies: `go mod download`
5. Create a self-signed SSL certificate and key, and place them in the `/etc/vuegolith/ssl/` directory. Name the files `server.crt` and `server.key`, respectively.
6. Run the backend server: `sudo go run .`
   Note: Running the server with sudo is necessary to access the `/etc/vuegolith/ssl/` directory.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
3. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Important Notes

### Backend Root Directory

The backend of Vuegolith is built using the Go programming language. It serves as a web server providing APIs and handling file uploads. The backend's root directory is where you have cloned the repository (e.g., `/path/to/vuegolith`).

### Frontend Root Directory

The frontend of Vuegolith is built using Vue.js and Vite. It is located in the `frontend` directory. When working with the frontend, make sure to navigate to the `frontend` directory using `cd frontend` before running any npm commands.

### Scripts in package.json

Here is a quick overview of the scripts available in the `package.json` file:

- `dev`: Starts the frontend development server.
- `build`: Builds the frontend and moves the output to the `ui/dist` directory.
- `preview`: Previews the built frontend locally.
- `boilerplate`: (Optional) Runs a Node.js script for boilerplate generation (you may provide more details about this if needed).
- `format`: Formats Vue files using Prettier.
- `eslint`: Runs ESLint for linting TypeScript and Vue files.
- `publish`: Publishes the frontend and backend as a single executable to `/usr/local/bin/vuegolith` (make sure to run this script with elevated permissions using `sudo`).

### Recommended NPM Commands

When working on the frontend, it is essential to execute the npm commands from within the `frontend` directory. For example:

- To install new dependencies: `npm install <package-name>`
- To run the development server: `npm run dev`
- To build the frontend: `npm run build`
- To preview the built frontend: `npm run preview`

Remember not to execute `npm install` in the root directory. Doing so will install dependencies at the project root, which is not recommended.

## Conclusion

Vuegolith provides a powerful combination of Go and Vue.js, allowing you to build a feature-rich web application with a robust backend. By following the instructions in this readme, you should be able to set up Vuegolith and start developing your web application.
